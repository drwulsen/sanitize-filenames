# sanitize-filenames
Sanitize linux filenames to work with windows

This script is nude, rude, crude. It can an will easily trash your system if invoked by mistake on a wrong directory.
So do not use this unless you are very sure of what you are doing.

Besides that, is does sanitzie a music collection folder to work with windows / ford sync3.
It will check for any special characters which are not compatible with FAT32 and ask you if you'd like to replace them.
It can also scan for missing album art (cover.jpg) in the directories.

Sure enough, you can use it on any folder, as it works on filenames, not metadata of the files.

If you ruin your system and you know it, please don't message me to show it, you've been warned here many times, so here it ends.
